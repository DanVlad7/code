git merge : merge changes from different branches

#Merging

Merging means to bring the changes from a branch to another one.

- A fast forward merge happens when the target branch was branched from the current one
and there are no new changes to the current branch since then.

 - An automatic merge happens when the two histories have diverged, 
 but git is able to reconcile them into one set of changes. This
 creates a new commit on the current branch.

git branch -c "nume branch" : creza un nou branch
git checkout "nume branch" : schimba pe noul branch
