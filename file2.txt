git merge : merge changes from different branches

#Merging

git merge --abort - abort an in progress merge

Merging means to bring the changes from a branch to another one.

- A fast forward merge happens when the target branch was branched from the current one
and there are no new changes to the current branch since then.

 - An automatic merge happens when the two histories have diverged, 
 but git is able to reconcile them into one set of changes. This
 creates a new commit on the current branch.

 git merge --no-commit --no-ff "branch-ul cu care vreau sa mergeuiesc"
    - nu commite si nu face fast forward la merge orice ar fi

#LOG

git log branch1..branch2 - log of commits that are in branch2 and not in
    -branch1

git log branch1...branch2 - log of commits in either branch but not in  
    -both

##PULL

##What is a remote?

A remote repo is one hosted outside of our local machine. We can add
remotes with 'git remote add', and set up *tracking branches* to track
differences between our local and remote repositories.

We push to remotes with 'git push', and fetch from then with 'git fetch'.
We can also fetch and merge with 'git pull'
